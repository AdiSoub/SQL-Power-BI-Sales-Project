🛒 Customer & Sales Insights Dashboard

SQL + Power BI Portfolio Project

By Adi Al Soub

📊 Project Overview

This project showcases my end-to-end data analysis workflow using PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin) and Power BI. The dataset simulates a retail business and includes information about customers, orders, products, payments, regions, and product reviews.

The goal is to demonstrate:

SQL querying proficiency

Data modeling and cleaning

Business intelligence storytelling using Power BI

🧩 Database Schema
The database includes the following tables:(customers, products, orders, order_details, payments, regions, product_reviews, sales_reps)

Each table is connected through proper primary/foreign key relationships and reflects realistic e-commerce operations.

📁 Key Features & Questions Answered

🔹 SQL Analysis

I wrote and verified over 25 SQL queries covering:

Customer acquisition and retention

Revenue analysis by region and product category

Product performance and order volume

Payment behavior and review activity

🔹 Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

Total revenue, orders, and customer KPIs

Monthly customer acquisition trends

Revenue by product category and country

Top products by revenue and quantity

Customers with no orders in the past 6 months

Some visuals are directly powered by SQL queries I developed; others use Power BI DAX and modeling.

📌 Dashboard Structure

The Power BI report is structured across 3 tabs:

1.  Overview

2. Customer Insights

3. Sales & Order Trends

4.Products Performance
